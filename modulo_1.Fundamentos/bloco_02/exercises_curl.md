### 21 curl exercises from blog [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/08/27/curl-exercises/)
### How to make different kinds of HTTP requests with curl 

1.  Request https://httpbin.org
```
curl https://httpbin.org
```

2. Request https://httpbin.org/anything. httpbin.org/anything will look at the request you made, parse it, and echo back to you what you requested. curl’s default is to make a GET request.
```
curl https://httpbin.org/anything
```
```
Response:

{
  "args": {}, 
  "data": "", 
  "files": {}, 
  "form": {}, 
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*", 
    "Host": "httpbin.org", 
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.68.0", 
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-61305649-4f5cd70a362e8428582490df"
  }, 
  "json": null, 
  "method": "GET", 
  "origin": "189.60.105.53", 
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/anything"
}
```

3. Make a POST request to https://httpbin.org/anything

4. Make a GET request to https://httpbin.org/anything, but this time add some query parameters (set value=panda).

5. Request google’s robots.txt file (www.google.com/robots.txt)

6. Make a GET request to https://httpbin.org/anything and set the header User-Agent: elephant.

7. Make a DELETE request to https://httpbin.org/anything

8. Request https://httpbin.org/anything and also get the response headers

9.  Make a POST request to https://httpbin.org/anything with the JSON body {"value": "panda"}

10. Make the same POST request as the previous exercise, but set the Content-Type header to application/json (because POST requests need to have a content type that matches their body). Look at the json field in the response to see the difference from the previous one.

11. Make a GET request to https://httpbin.org/anything and set the header Accept-Encoding: gzip (what happens? why?)

12. Put a bunch of a JSON in a file and then make a POST request to https://httpbin.org/anything with the JSON in that file as the body

13. Make a request to https://httpbin.org/image and set the header ‘Accept: image/png’. Save the output to a PNG file and open the file in an image viewer. Try the same thing with different Accept: headers.

14. Make a PUT request to https://httpbin.org/anything

15. Request https://httpbin.org/image/jpeg, save it to a file, and open that file in your image editor.

16. Request https://www.twitter.com. You’ll get an empty response. Get curl to show you the response headers too, and try to figure out why the response was empty.

17. Make any request to https://httpbin.org/anything and just set some nonsense headers (like panda: elephant)

18. Request https://httpbin.org/status/404 and https://httpbin.org/status/200. Request them again and get curl to show the response headers.

19. Request https://httpbin.org/anything and set a username and password (with -u username:password)

20. Download the Twitter homepage (https://twitter.com) in Spanish by setting the Accept-Language: es-ES header.


21. Make a request to the Stripe API with curl. (see https://stripe.com/docs/development for how, they give you a test API key). Try making exactly the same request to https://httpbin.org/anything.
